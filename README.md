> Canner, an agile Content Management System for APIs and Clouds. Build CMS faster and simpler with GraphQL, Prisma, Firebase and Restful APIs.


## Benefits and advantages (Simple. Agile. Flexible. Efficient - SAFE)

### üåç Simple, One Framework

Canner is flexible and agnostic, that you can ***learn once and create any form of CMS for many different databases.***

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Agile, Move Faster

By defining a Canner schema in JSX, you can determine how the CMS stores data in your databases and the appearance of the CMS UI/UX.

### üí™ Flexible, any Data Sources

With different connectors, you are able to create a CMS to interact with ***Firebase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GraphQL with the same schema***.

### üí∏ Efficient, Less is More

Since Canner schema ***is only a JSX (XML-like) language without any logistic code***, in other words, you can maintain your code in a configuration file and easy to maintain using version controls.

## Why Canner is different?

Canner adopts Adaptive CMS concept. Adaptive CMS is a new CMS structure that is different from traditional CMS and headless CMS. The biggest different about Adaptive CMS is that it decouples both view and data layer. It builds data interfaces to connect to single or multiple data sources.
