CannerCMS has pivoted to [CannerData - The Data Access Layer for
Analytics Data Applications](https://cannerdata.com/). 

Canner now provides solution designs for data teams so that data owners, stewards, and consumers can easily collaborate in one interface. It is an ease-of-use, scalable, secure platform for querying and analyzing information across multiple databases, Ô¨Åle systems, and other storage formats. Unlike current solutions that data is often manually integrated and transferred across different tools and sources, resulting in time-consuming and error-prone processes.
