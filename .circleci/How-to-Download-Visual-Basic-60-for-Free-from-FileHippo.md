Visual Basic 6.0 is not only a language for creating Windows applications, but also a tool for creating web applications. You can use Visual Basic 6.0 to create dynamic web pages that interact with databases, web services, and other web technologies.
 
To create web applications with Visual Basic 6.0, you need to use the Visual Basic WebClasses Designer, which is an add-in that you can install from the Visual Basic 6.0 CD-ROM. The WebClasses Designer allows you to create web classes, which are similar to forms in Windows applications, but are designed for the web. You can use web classes to handle user requests, generate HTML output, and communicate with other web components.
 
Some of the benefits of using web classes are:

- They simplify the development of web applications by providing a familiar and consistent programming model.
- They allow you to reuse code and components from your Windows applications.
- They support state management and session variables, which help you maintain information across multiple web pages.
- They support debugging and error handling, which help you test and troubleshoot your web applications.
